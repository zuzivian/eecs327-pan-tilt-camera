# FaceAssure
A security camera product that presents that tracks a person's face using openCV in the cloud.

## Description
We are developing a security camera product called FaceAssure that presents the operator a comprehensive view of the area, and a personâ€™s face as it moves across an area, using computer vision and multiple installed cameras. The owner is notified when an unknown person is detected so that they can investigate the situation.

We chose our project because we were interested making it useable for anti-theft purposes at home. Our first idea was to create a network of cameras linked together by a central server that provided an administrative overview for the homeowner. The pan and tilt servos made the most sense in helping a security system cover a large angle in the room. Finally, our interest in exploring computer vision made it possible to control servos autonomous using facial detection.
